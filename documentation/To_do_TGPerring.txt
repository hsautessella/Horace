Update documentation - multi cut for sqw; case of no proj for sqw

write dimsplit

Handling of errors in cut_sqw_main_single; mustn't crash cut_sqw_main

move output sqw file open check; write for multi output

refine timing output if necessary


=================================================================================
Detpar, proj should be classes in their own right in sqw objects

dnd should have 4 components of Q

pix array should hold unsymmetrised q coordinates

Need a flag to say if symmetrised

Need a flag to say if energy shifted or not

'ave' option is problematic if have symmetrised cut

symmetrisation work for non-orthogonal lattices

instrument needs to be a class
