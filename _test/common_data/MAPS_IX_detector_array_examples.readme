There are four IX_detector_array objects that you can read into a structure
>> D = load(‘MAPS_IX_detector_array_examples.mat’)

The four fields have the variable names:
MAPS_dets                   the full MAPS detector array
MAPS_dets_banks        the same, but composed out of 14 separate banks (to exercise how you might handle this)
MAPS_dets_A1B1         a cut down version which holds only two of the 14 MAPS detector banks
MAPS_dets_E1C1D1     likewise, but three different banks

The bottom two examples which can be used to simulate data that come from two different instrumnets, 
or Greg’s problem of two different calibrations of the same instrument. The numbers of detectors in the banks 
are different in the two cases so that it should be easier to spot errors in any debugging.
